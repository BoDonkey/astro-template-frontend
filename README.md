# astro-template-frontend

This is an Astro-based website, with editable content powered by ApostropheCMS.

To complete your project, you will need to fork *two* repositories:
this one (the starting point for your Astro project), and the
[`apostrophecms/starter-kit-astro-template`](https://github.com/BoDonkey/starter-kit-astro-template)
project.


Then, you need to run both with the `APOS_EXTERNAL_FRONT_KEY` environment variable set to the same string in both projects.
